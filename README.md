# tsets

Single source of error based state space models (exponential smoothing)
including the power MAM model, normalized seasonality and ability to
include regressors in the observation equation. Part of a unified time
series framework using methods and classes from tsmethods. Estimation
supports automatic differentiation via the TMB package.

Since v.1.9.0, missing values are automatically handled via the
prediction/update step during estimation.
