# 2022-04-13 v0.3.0 [AG]
# Replaced all snow and doParallel functionality with future package. The cores
argument is now removed from options of all functions and instead the user
can just setup a plan via the future package which is much simpler and allows
much more customization. This may break backwards compatibility with versions
less than this which made use of the cores argument.
# Bumped version to 0.3.0 across all affected packages.
# Made solver nlminb and autodiff (TRUE) defaults across all functions.
# Removed options for drop_na, drop_negative and redraw in the prediction
function. The user is left to choose what to do when a model is mispecified
so badly that it returns negative values. The problem with removing negatives
is that it biases the mean considerably effectively imposting a half normal
distribution (not an assumption of the estimation for additive models).
# Added analytic moments (tsmoments) method for class of models 1, 2, 3 and
approximate function (exact for h<m) for class 3 with regressors.
# Fixed a bug in the bounds of the multiplicative error model for the seaasonal
initialization when estimate was set to TRUE.
# The class of model is now returned in the specification object
# Next version will look into adding admissible bounds (code from R.Hyndman),
and fixing how the seed value gets passed.

# 2022-03-01 v0.2.4 [AG]
# Added extra arguments to ets_modelspec to take a transformation. This now
follows the added functionality in tsaux for wrapping all transformation in
the tstransform function (currently box-cox and logit). Logit is for positively
bounded series (usually 0-1 range such as probabilities) and follows the
logit-normal distribution. This is a simpler assumption than using a beta
distribution.
# Added init_states to the prediction method (similar to issm predict) to
allow for prediction to be initialized from a different state vector rather
than the last one.

# 2022-02-20 v0.2.3 [AG]
# Fix to tsbacktest in passing lambda.
# ets_modelspec now checks whether lambda is to be estimated and saves
# the decision in the transform slot (knowing this determines whether lambda
is to be estimated at each iteration of the backtest or kept fixed).

# 2021-09-03 v0.2.2 [AG]
# Changed the regressor type in the Multiplicative Error model (with non
additive Trend) to have multiplicative regressor formulated as (1 +
\beta \X). This is more consistent with this type of model rather than
the previously included additive regressor.
# Added an option to initialize the regressor coefficients for the Additive
error model, with lower and upper bounds based on the pre-estimation standard
deviation of the estimated coefficient.

# 2021-09-03 v0.2.1 [AG]
- Added option in tsbacktest to re-estimate the model every n periods expanding
the default of re-estimating every 1 period.
- Added option in tsbacktest to apply a custom function to each path draw (e.g.
sum, max etc) since we may be interested in having the distribution of some
statistic over the entire forecast horizon.
- Rolled out changes similar to those applied in tsissm package.

# 2021-04-20 v0.1.9 [AG]
- Missing values are now allowed and handled both on initialization as well
as for the likelihood/estimation (which is estimated on the non missing values),
with zero noise filtering (mean prediction) performed on the missing values in
the states.
- Update: all methods now corrected to work with missing values

# 2021-04-07 v0.1.8 [AG]
- Added power_model option in auto_ets with default of FALSE (power MAM models
should not be included as default as their properties still need more research)
- Imported crps from tsaux and added to metrics method for predict object.
- Added GNU make to SystemRequirements for the non portable Makevars

# 2020-11-23 v0.1.7 [AG]
- Added custom slope component to predict function to allow user override of slope in forecast.
- Fix to residuals for case when there is no lambda but raw is set to TRUE

# 2020-09-16 v0.1.6 [AG]
- Fix to tsbacktest when no alpha (coverage parameter) is provided.
- Added Changelog to package
