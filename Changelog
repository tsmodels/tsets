# 2021-09-03 v0.2.2 [AG]
# Changed the regressor type in the Multiplicative Error model (with non 
additive Trend) to have multiplicative regressor formulated as (1 + 
\beta \X). This is more consistent with this type of model rather than
the previously included additive regressor.
# Added an option to initialize the regressor coefficients for the Additive
error model, with lower and upper bounds based on the pre-estimation standard
deviation of the estimated coefficient.

# 2021-09-03 v0.2.1 [AG]
- Added option in tsbacktest to re-estimate the model every n periods expanding
the default of re-estimating every 1 period.
- Added option in tsbacktest to apply a custom function to each path draw (e.g.
sum, max etc) since we may be interested in having the distribution of some
statistic over the entire forecast horizon.
- Rolled out changes similar to those applied in tsissm package.

# 2021-04-20 v0.1.9 [AG]
- Missing values are now allowed and handled both on initialization as well
as for the likelihood/estimation (which is estimated on the non missing values),
with zero noise filtering (mean prediction) performed on the missing values in
the states.
- Update: all methods now corrected to work with missing values

# 2021-04-07 v0.1.8 [AG]
- Added power_model option in auto_ets with default of FALSE (power MAM models 
should not be included as default as their properties still need more research)
- Imported crps from tsaux and added to metrics method for predict object.
- Added GNU make to SystemRequirements for the non portable Makevars

# 2020-11-23 v0.1.7 [AG]
- Added custom slope component to predict function to allow user override of slope in forecast.
- Fix to residuals for case when there is no lambda but raw is set to TRUE

# 2020-09-16 v0.1.6 [AG]
- Fix to tsbacktest when no alpha (coverage parameter) is provided.
- Added Changelog to package
